# Unity3D-Shaders-showcase-01
A series of shaders and camera effects made with Unity 2017.3.1f1.

Upon downloading the project, you should be either in the "Camera_effects" scene or the "Shaders_effects" scene. To test the shaders on either scene : 

- Scene n°1 : The scripts are all located on the FirstPersonCharacter gameObject inside the FPSController Note that they were not designed to be combined in the first place, so remeber to enable them one at a time.

- Scene n°2 : All available shaders are already loaded in scene, so you shouldn't have a problem testing them. If some of these shaders do not work, feel free to send me a message explaining me what went wrong so I can fix them.

Feel free to experiment with the shaders, tweaking their values and modifying their scripts to impove them and suit them to your needs.
